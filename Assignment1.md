A lot of people enjoy our Ontario provincial parks. So much so that it is hard to get a reservation. Part of the whole camping experience is the campfire. You will write a campfire story or game that can run as an SMS or Messenger BOT. It can be a choose your own adventure type story or a "never can tell" type guessing game against the computer.
